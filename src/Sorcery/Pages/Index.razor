            and written in C#, with the help of <MudLink Href="https://mudblazor.com/">MudBlazor</MudLink> components.
            It contains as little JavaScript as possible while still being presentable, which means it uses the
            <MudLink Href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</MudLink>, <MudLink Href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</MudLink>,
            and the <MudLink Href="https://asciinema.org/">Asciinema</MudLink> player libraries.

            All resources are statically hosted, literally no external sites are called from here.
            There is no trackers and I do not store any personal information.
            I know, complete avant-garde. I wish "Web 3.0" was this instead of whatever it's
            being sold as right now.
