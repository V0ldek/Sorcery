        Buckle up, it's time for the first assignment! We first need to setup the GitHub
        Classroom machinery so that you can focus on the code and have tests running automatically for you.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h2" Class="mx-auto py-2">GitHub</MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        You should be familiar with git. I assume you know its basics, and if you don't please
        go read any of the available tutorials and come back.
    </MudText>    
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        You need a GitHub account, so go ahead and set it up if you haven't got one. When you set it up,
        go to the ClassroomIntro assignment with <Link Href="https://classroom.github.com/a/jxmAjZFn" Target="_blank">this invite</Link>.
        You need to accept the assignment, and then you'll be transported to a repo created just for you.
        You can also go straight to VS Code.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h2" Class="mx-auto py-2">What's in an assignment?</MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        The assignment's description and goals will be described in the top-level README file.
        It will also contain any instructions on how to run the project. In this case,
        there's nothing to say, so it's rather short.
    </MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        Every assignment will be described in more detail on this website, in the assignment section
        at the end of each module. Your goal is to read it, understand it, and implement
        what it asks you to implement. The tests in the repository will guide you,
        but they are <em>not</em> the sole indicator of success.
    </MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        GitHub automatically creates a PR for you, called Feedback. It will automatically
        update whenever you push a commit, letting me know about your changes and running tests for you.
        That means that if you start doing the exercise early, I will be able to jump in to your PR and give you feedback.
        That's basically points for free &ndash; you can fix the mistakes before the deadline and avoid losing points for them.
        However, I make no promises about the frequency of my feedback on those, after all, there's quite a few of you and I'm
        not always available.
    </MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        As a reminder: you can get up to 2 points for the tests and 3 for code style. The tests score is visible in the
        Feedback PR, and will be between 0 and 200 &ndash; divide them by 100 to get your actual points for grading.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h2" Class="mx-auto py-2">VS Code integration</MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        Arguably the coolest feature is VS Code integration. Click the magical "<em>Open in Visual Studio Code</em>"
        button and you'll get put into VS Code. The first time it will ask you to download some extensions &ndash; let it.
        On the left hand side there will be the GitHub logo <MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Custom.Brands.GitHub"></MudIcon>.
        Click it and sign in. You will need to authorise VS Code to login to GitHub.
    </MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        Once you're there, you'll see the list of all your classroom assignments. You can expand them
        to see the test status, and you can interact with the PR from there. Click around and explore!
    </MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        Under the GitHub icon there's also the Live Share tab. You can invite other students, or me, to do
        pair-programming and share the code space. I'm not sure how well-refined this feature is, but feel
        free to try it out!
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h2" Class="mx-auto py-2">Privacy</MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        If you're worried &ndash; only I will be able to see your code and grade.
        The repository is private and cannot be accessed by anyone else.
        You can make it public in the Settings, if you want.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h2" Class="mx-auto py-2">Summary</MudText>
    <MudText GutterBottom="true">
        We know how to use GitHub Classroom and its VS Code integration. Complete the test assignment
        by filling the <Code>Adder</Code> and <Code>HelloWorld</Code> classes to make sure everything
        is configured correctly.
