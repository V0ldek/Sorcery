    <Paragraph>
        Running through Dungeon simulations also takes too much time.
        An ingenious idea is being thrown around &ndash; maybe independent simulations could
        be done simultaneously? This would require training for the person responsible
        for the whiteboard with run results to multitask.
    </Paragraph>
    <Header2>Overview</Header2>
    <Paragraph>
        We will be parallelising dungeon runs, so that many simulations can be performed
        quickly to find best possible results for our Heroes. This will require
        creating a ranking that can be safely accessed from multiple threads.
    </Paragraph>
    <Header2>Task 0. &ndash; Concurrent Ranking</Header2>
    <Paragraph>
        Implement the <Code>ConcurrentBestRunsCollection</Code> in <Code>DungeonWalker.Logic.Statistics</Code>.
        The collection must be thread-safe for all methods. You can achieve that however you like, but the
        recommendation is <Code>System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableSet</Code>.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        In the spirit of "immutable is thread-safe", using an immutable collections will make many things easier.
        As a reminder, immutable collections return a reference to a new collection instance on modification instead
        of actually mutating the original. You will still need to <Code>lock</Code> the reference on writes.
        Pay attention to the ranking enumerator &ndash; makes sure that it actually enumerates over a stable snapshot
        of the collection!
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        The tricky part is <Code>Remove</Code>. You need to return a boolean specifying whether the element was removed.
        The immutable collection returns only a reference to a modified collection. Note, however, that if an element
        is <em>not</em> removed, then the reference returned is the same as the original. In other words,
        if <Code>x</Code> is not in <Code>collection</Code>, then <CodeBlock Code="object.ReferenceEquals(collection, collection.Remove(x))"/>.

    <Header2>Task 1. &ndash; Game Engine</Header2>
    <Paragraph>
        We should now utilise this thread-safe collection in the <Code>GameEngine</Code> located in
        <Code>DungeonWalker.Logic.Execution</Code>. The <Code>RunMultiple</Code> method heuristically checks
        whether multithreading would be beneficial &ndash; at least ten times as many items as CPU cores.
        The fallback version is a simple sequential loop.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        Your entire task is to implement <Code>RunMany</Code> using the <Code>ConcurrentBestRunsCollection</Code>
        for collecting results and PLINQ for processing. Note that there are no correctness tests for this
        &ndash; you will need to manually run the Play endpoind through the Swagger API, or by using the
        <code>test_multiple_runs</code> script.
