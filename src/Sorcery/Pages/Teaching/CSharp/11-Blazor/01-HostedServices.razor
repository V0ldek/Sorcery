    <Paragraph>
        Normally, an ASP.NET Core server simply handles requests. An HTTP request comes, all of the machinery processes it, gives a response,
        and then ends. However, sometimes we want servers to be able to perform long-running tasks not tied to a particular request.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        A Hosted Service is a piece of code that runs on the server independent of requests. It will continue running
        even if users stop issuing requests. Usual use case is to have a worker service that performs tasks taken from some asynchronous queue.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        All you need to do to implement a Hosted Service is to inherit from <Code>BackgroundService</Code> and then implement its <Code>ExecuteAsync</Code>
        method. Channels that we covered in <Link Href="@channels.Route">@channels.DisplayName</Link> are an ideal asynchronous queue
        to use with such services.
