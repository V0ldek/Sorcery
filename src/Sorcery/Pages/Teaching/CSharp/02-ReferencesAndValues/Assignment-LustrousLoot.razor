    <Paragraph>
        Our tenacious heroes are strong, but not strong enough!
        To defeat their enemies they need reliable equipment and powerful trinkets
        that will enhance their abilities. The Dark Lord's machinery in the dungeon
        can be used to make the weapons even deadlier and <span class="armour">armour</span> even sturdier...
    </Paragraph>
    <Header2>Overview</Header2>
    <Paragraph>
        Throughout the course we will be working on our DungeonWalker and making it more into a real game!
        This time we will be revisiting Loot and making it more fledged out by splitting it into Equipment
        and Consumable items.
    </Paragraph>
    <Header2>Task 0. &ndash; Modifiers and Health</Header2>
    <Paragraph>
        If you compare Health Potions to Damage Crystals and Chainmails, a key difference emerges &ndash;
        the first one gets consumed and applies its effects immediately, while the other two give permanent
        modifiers to the Hero &ndash; these we call Equipment. We want to expand on this by creating a <Code>Modifier</Code> type that
        will model that.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        First, we define an <Code>EquipmentBase</Code> abstract class that can be implemented by items
        to indicate they are not one-timers, but rather permanent additions to the Hero's arsenal.
        It has a single property, which returns a <Code>Modifier</Code>, and a <Code>TryUpgrade</Code>
        method that we will use later:
    </Paragraph>
    <CodeBlock FileName="DungeonWalker.Logic/Loot/Equipment/IEquipment.cs" Code="@(@"
using DungeonWalker.Logic.Characters;

namespace DungeonWalker.Logic.Loot.Equipment;

public abstract class EquipmentBase
{
    public Modifier Modifier => throw new NotImplementedException();

    public bool TryUpgrade() => throw new NotImplementedException();
}
    ")" />
    <Paragraph>
        As usual, you can freely add stuff to this class, just don't change the two existing signatures.
        A Modifier is currently a rather dumb type:
    </Paragraph>
    <CodeBlock FileName="DungeonWalker.Logic/Characters/Modifier.cs" Code="@(@"
namespace DungeonWalker.Logic.Characters;

public struct Modifier
{
    public int AttackDamageModifier { get; init; }

    public int ArmourModifier { get; init; }

    public int MaxHealthModifier { get; init; }
}
")" />
    <Paragraph>
        We'd like it to be more useful. Your first task is to implement relevant operators and methods:

        <MudList Class="my-2">
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-plus">addition of two Modifiers that simply adds all individual modifier values;</MudListItem>
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-minus">dual to addition, subtraction of two Modifiers</MudListItem>
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-xmark">multiplication by a <Code>float</Code> scalar that multiplies all individual modifier values, rounding down;</MudListItem>
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-circle-minus">unary negation, equivalent to multiplying by negative one.</MudListItem>
        </MudList>
    </Paragraph>

    <MudText>
        We also want a readable <Code>ToString</Code> representation, e.g. our friend Chainmail would give this modifier:
    </MudText>
    <CodeBlock Language="plain" Code="@(@"🛡 +5")" />

    <MudText>
        A magical sword that grants extraordinary strength could give:
    </MudText>
    <CodeBlock Language="plain" Code="@(@"❤️ +10 ⚔️ +10")" />

    <MudText>
        And a legendary artefact could grant:
    </MudText>
    <CodeBlock Language="plain" Code="@(@"❤️ +20 ⚔️ +15 🛡 +15")" />

    <Paragraph>
        In short, just write out the non-zero modifiers in order <span class="health">max health</span>, <span class="damage">damage</span>, <span class="armour">armour</span>.
        If the Modifier is zero across the board, print <Code>"nothing"</Code>.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        To finish working with Modifiers, we need to change how Characters interact with it.
        The Character class has been reworked to have immutable base statistics and a Modifier, but it is bugged!
        It can cause the Character to have less <span class="health">health</span> than zero &ndash; you need to fix that.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        You also need to fix the Hero's <Code>DisableTenacity</Code> and <Code>EnableTenacity</Code> methods
        to apply the modifier correctly.
    </Paragraph>


    <CodeBlock FileName="DungeonWalker.Logic/Characters/Hero.cs" Code="@(@"
//...

private void DisableTenacity()
{
    throw new NotImplementedException(""Should add Tenacity here!"");
    _isTenacityActive = false;
}

private void EnableTenacity()
{
    throw new NotImplementedException(""Should remove Tenacity here!"");
    _isTenacityActive = true;
}
")" />

    <MudAlert Class="my-4" Severity="Severity.Warning" Variant="Variant.Outlined">
        The tests do not compile until you finish this Task.
        If you add the required operators to the <Code>Modifier</Code> type they will compile.

    <Header2>Task 1. &ndash; Equipment</Header2>

    <Paragraph>
        Now we rework the existing Loot system to split items between Consumables and Equipment.
        Not all Equipment is equal. There are five distinct types of items the Heroes may equip:

        <MudList Class="my-2">
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-hand-fist"><strong>Melee Weapon</strong></MudListItem>
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-wand-sparkles"><strong>Ranged Weapon</strong></MudListItem>
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-vest"><strong>Armour</strong></MudListItem>
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-shield-blank"><strong>Shield</strong></MudListItem>
            <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-hat-wizard"><strong>Trinket</strong></MudListItem>
        </MudList>
        These types constrain who can equip them.
    </Paragraph>

    <MudList>
        <MudListItem Icon="fas fa-wind">
            <MudText Color="Color.Default">
                <Code>Rogue</Code> &ndash;

        </MudListItem>
    </MudList>

    <Paragraph>
        You need to implement the missing <Code>TryEquip</Code> method on
        the <Code>Hero</Code> class and potentially all inheriting classes.

    <Paragraph>
        There's also a missing method in <Code>LootFactory</Code>.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        A Hero only picks up the Equipment if they have a slot to fit it into.
        If they do not then the item is ignored. This logic needs to be placed in
        <Code>Hero.TryEquip</Code>.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        Since picking up Loot can now result in the Hero ignoring it, we need to tweak the Loot messages a bit.
        Here's an example:
    </Paragraph>

    <CodeBlock Language="plain" Code="@(@"

  - a Health Potion! It restores ❤️ 17!
