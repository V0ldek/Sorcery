        The task is simple, I want you to look at some text and tell me if it contains only <em>alphabetic characters</em>,
        or, in other words, <em>letters</em>. There are other similar problems, maybe we want to check if the text contains
        any letters (because we're writing a password validation policy and hate happiness). In any case, the root issue
        is telling whether a given character is a letter. <Highlight>And you're probably doing it wrong</Highlight>.

        There are two ways we could attempt to do that, depending on the tools available to us.
        We can simply go through the characters in a string and check if it's a letter!
